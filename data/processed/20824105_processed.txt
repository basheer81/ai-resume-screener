Integrated the network to release dynamic IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to provide firewall protection NFS IPsec VPN Multiclient server chat application Spring 2018 Developed a real time multiclient server chat application in Python for a chat group by implementing socket programming Secured the application by providing features like AES encryption SHA 256 MD5 and symmetric key method Client server Socket Programming using TCP in Python Fall 2017 Developed a Python script for the client on Linux for performing a set of mathematical expressions sent by the server Evaluated the result by receiving a flag sent by the server to the client on successful execution of the mathematical expressions indicating a secure and successful TCP socket clientserver connection establishment SDN based Load Balancer Fall 2017 Designed a softwaredefined network to provide server load distribution for a pool of HTTP servers by analyzing the incoming packets and routing accordingly Optimized congestion by performing load balancing in round robin technique for the POX controller by using Openflow Switch Client server application for publickey cryptography in Python Fall 2017 Developed a secured TCP connection for encryption and decryption of text file and matched the output at the receiver Created public key cryptography to generate a set of public and private key pem file by using RSA
