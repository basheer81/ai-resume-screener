Front End Developer

This isn’t your typical frontend role. We care more about performance and reliability than shiny UI, and we’ve already integrated AI tools into how we build, test, and ship code. From automating workflows to boosting productivity with Claude/GPT, AI is part of our DNA.

Here’s what you’ll be doing:

✅ Own and refine our frontend architecture in Vue.js 3

✅ Focus on performance, scalability, and reliability across browsers

✅ Collaborate with backend engineers to handle complex data flows

✅ Lead by example with clean, maintainable code and testing best practices

✅ Use AI to code smarter, ship faster, and raise the bar

What we’re looking for:

8+ years in frontend development
3+ years with Vue.js (v3 preferred)
Strong JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Experience leading frontend projects or teams
Someone who already uses AI in their workflow
